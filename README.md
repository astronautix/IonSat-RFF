# IonSat-RFF
This repository hosts the RFF (Realtime Flight Framework), developped for french Ecole Polytechnique's student space center and its cubesat IonSat. It was created as a framework to help with realtime embeddedded development by wrapping the RTOS and a custom event-driven library into a simple C++ library. It is powered by the Meson build system generator for ease of use.
