# RFF and real-time operating systems

## The goal

We wanted the RFF to be very decoupled from the OS, while leaving access to all the low-level features. Also, The RFF RTOS implementation needs to be modern (c++, object-oriented, memory-safe) and user-friendly.

## FreeRTOS

The original RTOS integration has been done with FreeRTOS.
